# 🐶 Shepherd

Shepherd displays Facebook / Twitter app icon on your phone but opens Kindle, Pocket or other productive app.

### [Demo, features, installation](http://shepherd.artpi.net/)

## Why?

I found myself scrolling facebook mindlessly. I know I can uninstall it, but while travelling its useful to post photos.

And now I am back to scrolling...
So I wrote shepherd to guard my sheep mind into proper behaviour.

## Can this open XYZ app?, pretend to be ABC app?
